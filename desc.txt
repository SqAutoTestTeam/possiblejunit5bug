Static method annotated with @BeforeEach ruins execution of the rest of tests.


It is probable that I've encountered a bug related to execution of batch of tests.
When one of these test classes has a static method annotated with @BeforeEach - the whole batch is skipped.
Although the case with Static method annotated with @BeforeEach it is an error, it must not
ruin the rest of tests execution


Current behavior
   Error is written to log
   No tests in batch are executed&

Expected behavior
   Error is still written to log
   Execute those test classes that are well-formed (have annotations over mwthods with right modifiers) and
   skip execution for those that are not.
